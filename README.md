# üå≥ Decision Trees vs Random Forests - Classification Project

## üìå Project Overview
This project compares **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests** for a classification problem. The goal is to analyze their **performance differences**, highlighting how **ensemble learning (Random Forests) improves predictive accuracy**.  

### Decision Tree:
A decision tree is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm, which is utilized for both classification and regression tasks. It has a hierarchical, tree structure, which consists of a root node, branches, internal nodes and leaf nodes.

### Random Forests:
Random forest is a commonly-used machine learning algorithm, trademarked by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler, that combines the output of multiple decision trees to reach a single result.

## üîç Key Insights:  
- Decision Trees **overfitted the training data**, leading to lower test accuracy.  
- Random Forests **performed better** by reducing variance and improving generalization.
