# 🌳 Decision Trees vs Random Forests - Classification Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project compares **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests** for a classification problem. The goal is to analyze their **performance differences**, highlighting how **ensemble learning (Random Forests) improves predictive accuracy**.  

🔍 **Key Insights**:  
- Decision Trees **overfitted the training data**, leading to lower test accuracy.  
- Random Forests **performed better** by reducing variance and improving generalization.
